#### Tuesday, Januari 9
- [Update 7.3.0.5] [1]
- [Checkmate Changes in Update 7.3.0.5] [2]:
  > Based on player feedback, weâ€™re making some changes to Checkmate in tomorrowâ€™s update. Due to the amount of tuning,
  > Checkmate will be moved back to Labs.
  > 
  > Next week will feature 3v3 Clash which has been modified to reflect a fan favorite mode from the original Destiny,
  > Skirmish.
  > 
  > We'll also be adjusting all Primary weapons to join Hand Cannons in having the same optimal Time-to-Kill (TTK) as
  > they do in the base sandbox. In modes like Clash and Control, you will now start the game with two kills worth of
  > special ammo (ex. 2 shots for shotguns).
  > 
  > Weâ€™re increasing the amount of special ammo credit you get for assists and deaths, so you will get special ammo
  > pulls more frequently, but are reducing the amount of special ammo you get from approximately three kills worth to
  > two kills, to reduce snowballing.
  > 
  > We want the reduced uptime of abilities in the PvP sandbox, but the current level of ability cooldown tuning made
  > some abilities feel impractical to use. Ability cooldown penalties are being reduced from 30% to 15% and melee
  > damage is being increased to allow two melees to kill.
  > 
  > We will run one more Checkmate Trials Lab later this season (on February 9) with the new tuning, but Checkmate is
  > not currently planned to be in the Control node again.
  > 
  > We will have the full details on everything that is changing with weapon archetype tuning and other game mode rules
  > in the patch notes tomorrow.
  > 
  > We'll continue to review feedback as you play so please try out this new iteration and tell us how it feels.
  - Clarifications by Mercules:
    - > You only start the game with special, all future special must be earned. Respawning does not give you additional
      > ammo. [3]
    - > You retain \[ammo after death\]. [4]
    - >> If you had ammo and died, as long as you didnâ€™t get revived, it carried to the next round.
      > 
      > \[This is\] a bug, should be fixed by next trials lab \[February 9\] [5]
    - > Special weapon kills donâ€™t grant progress towards additional special ammo. [6]
